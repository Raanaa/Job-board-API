Job Board

Your task is to implement a simple Job Board backend API. Detailed specifications for the test project are provided below. We estimate that you will not need more than a single weekend at relaxed coding speed to implement it.

## Project Description

The Job Board API will be used by your Users (Job Seekers) to perform the following tasks:

- List Job Posts
- Apply to Jobs

Every User (Job Seeker) will have their own job applications that have statuses that can be checked (seen, not seen). Job Posts are managed by other Users (Admin).

The Job Board app will be used by your Admin User to perform the following tasks:

- Manage A Job Post
- List Job Applications
- List Job Posts

## Technical details

Your backend should be able to serve all kinds of clients (which you do not have to implement) - using a RESTful API.

The following technical requirements are placed on your implementation:

### API

- Use Ruby (v2.3+) with Ruby on Rails framework (v5.0+)
- HTTP responses should follow best practices
- API should communicate with their clients using JSON data structures
- Implement authentication that would be the best for the clients by your opinion check `devise_token_auth` or `JWT`

### Resource Permission

- Job Seekers are not authorized to manage the Job
- Admin Users are not authorized to destroy job applications and users.
- You can use either the `cancancan` or `pundit` gems to do this

### Data Storage

- All data should be stored in a relational database, use Sqlite

### Users

- Registrations should be done with email and password (Job Seekers)
- There should be one Admin account, which will manage Job Posts
- You should implement the following functionality:
  - User Registration (Job Seekers only)
  - User Login

### Job Post data

- You should implement the following functionality:
  - Job Post must have: title, description
  - Create a new Job Post (Admin)
  - Update or delete existing Job Post (Admin)
  - List all Job Applications (Admin & Job Seeker)

### Job Applications

- You should implement the following functionality:
  - Job seekers apply to any job by creating a Job Application that will have a status of (Not Seen) by default
  - When an Admin User views a Job Application this will change their status to (Seen)

### Test / Rspec

- Your code should be tested using Rspec
  - Models
  - Controllers
